# SolARC

The Solar Energy from our sun can help us combat the global energy crisis with ease.

However, even with all the advances made in the field, Solar Energy sounds confusing to a common man, and he is left wondering if switching to Solar is actually worth the investment, considering the fact that there is a significant decrease in energy production in times of Storms, on a cloudy day or at night.

SolARC app aims to tackle this issue, and help the common man understand his own energy requirements and also guide him towards the optimal usage of the Energy available in case the forecast says that the weather today is not going to be clear.


## Stack
The SolARC app is built for Android using Native Android Studio and Java Code, along with corresponding Databases.

The server side part, although tiny, is used to help a user make an informed decision when he is in the market for Solar Equipment. This Server runs on an instance of Amazon EC2 with Python (Flask).
